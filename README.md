This repositorie presents my submission in kaggle [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). <br>

In this competition, the <b>goal</b> is to perform a 2-label <b>classification problem</b>: predict which <b>passengers survived</b> the tragedy. <be>. This competition offers two datasets. One training, where the labels are known, and one testing where the labels are unknown. The goal is to submit a file with predictions, which say whether someone survived or not. <br> All of the data, pictures and score are set in my repository.

Columns include: 
- Variable :	Definition	: Key
