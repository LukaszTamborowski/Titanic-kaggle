### Overview
This project is designed to predict the stock price of a particular company using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the stock price of a company based on historical data.

### Data Collection
The data for this project is collected from a reputable source such as Yahoo Finance or Google Finance. The data includes information such as the opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume of the stock for a given period.

### Data Preprocessing
The data collected is then preprocessed to ensure that it is in a suitable format for building the machine learning model. This may include cleaning the data, dealing with missing values, and normalizing the data.

### Model Building
The next step is to build the machine learning model. This project uses the popular TensorFlow library to build a deep learning model. The model is trained on the preprocessed data and the goal is to optimize the model so that it can accurately predict the stock price of a company based on the historical data.

### Model Evaluation
The model is then evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, and mean absolute error. The goal is to achieve the highest accuracy possible and to minimize the mean squared and mean absolute error.

### Deployment
Finally, the model is deployed and made available to users who can use the model to predict the stock price of a particular company. This may involve creating a web application or a mobile application that allows users to input the necessary information and receive a prediction.
